My Repo for 42 School Projects
I began my programming adventure at 42 School Piscine in November 2021. 
I have loved taking on a new challenge and getting my head around a new industry and new skills. 
This repo contains branches with all my 42 courses and projects. 
Apart from being a programming student I am also forging a career as an actor and musician. Find out more on my website www.bencosford.com
